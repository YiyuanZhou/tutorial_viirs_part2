1. Downloading data

   Before you can use VIIRS data do do anything interesting, you must [download the VIIRS data](download_data.md).

1. Working with data

   After downloading the data, you'll surely want to do something interesting with it.
   We have written [a tutorial](geo_json.md) with examples of how to look at data for particular geographical regions.

1. Visualizing data

   We also have an example of an [end-to-end website](https://github.com/bayeshack2016/sysj/tree/master/site)
   that lets you visualize VIIRS data (and other county data) for different counties and time periods,
   by imposing the data a map.
